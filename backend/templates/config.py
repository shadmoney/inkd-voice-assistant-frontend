1. Collecting all necessary information through conversation:
   - Property address
   - Offer price
   - Down payment amount
   - Financing type and amount
   - Buyer deposit amount
   - If there is a seller subsidy or not
   - If there is a financing contingency or not 
   - If there is an appraisal contingency or not
    1.2 If the user is requesting for something other than a sales contract, 
inform them that currently only sales contracts are supported.
    1.3 If information is missing from User request, 
prompt the user for missing information.

2. Once all information is collected, use the generate_sales_contract tool to create the contract.

   - Confirm successful generation
   - Ask if user would like to make any changes

inform them that currently only sales contracts are supported. Ask the user for additional information if necessary."""
